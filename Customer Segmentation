## Introduction

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to identify customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## Load Libraries

```{r}
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Load Data

```{r}
df <- read.csv("Mall_Customers.csv")
head(df)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
summary(df)
table(df$Gender)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution")

ggplot(df, aes(x = Annual.Income..k.., y = Spending.Score..1.100.)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Income vs Spending Score")
```

## Data Preprocessing

```{r}
df_num <- df %>% select(Age, Annual.Income..k.., Spending.Score..1.100.)
df_scaled <- scale(df_num)
```

## Determine Optimal Number of Clusters

```{r}
fviz_nbclust(df_scaled, kmeans, method = "wss") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, linetype = 2) +
  labs(title = "Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters")
```

## Apply K-Means Clustering

```{r}
set.seed(123)
kmeans_result <- kmeans(df_scaled, centers = 5, nstart = 25)
df$Cluster <- as.factor(kmeans_result$cluster)
```

## Visualize Clusters

```{r}
fviz_cluster(kmeans_result, data = df_scaled,
             ellipse.type = "euclid",
             geom = "point",
             stand = FALSE,
             palette = "jco",
             ggtheme = theme_minimal()) +
  labs(title = "Customer Segments")
```

## Cluster Profiles

```{r}
cluster_summary <- aggregate(df_num, by = list(Cluster = df$Cluster), mean)
cluster_summary
```

## Insights & Recommendations

Cluster 1: High income, high spending — Target with premium offers.  
Cluster 2: Low income, high spending — Potential risk, offer budget-conscious value.  
Cluster 3: High income, low spending — Re-engage with loyalty programs.  
Cluster 4: Average income, moderate spending — Upsell with tailored promotions.  
Cluster 5: Young low-income group — Grow with entry-level products.

## Conclusion

K-Means clustering provided valuable insights into customer behavior. These segments can inform marketing strategies, customer retention, and product offerings.
